Input processing
=============================

### Task 1
Given a text on multiple lines at standard input, print all words that can be found in the text. A word is considered a sequence of printable character different than any whitespace. If whitespaces are encountered, compact all adiacent ones and print a space (' ') character instead, except newline (which shall be kept as it is). Skip all digits and non-printable characters.

The program should stop when the entire text has been processed.

| Input                                               | Output  |
|---                                                  |---      |
|123abc23a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;567ab   | abca ab |
|asdg456&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asd356                      | asdg asd |
|35!79ah&nbsp;&nbsp;                                  | !ah    |

### Task 2
Given a text on multiple lines at standard input, print all words that start with an uppercase letter or a symbol. A word is considered a sequence of printable character different than any whitespace. If whitespaces are encountered, compact all adiacent ones and print a space (' ') character instead, except newline (which shall be kept as it is). Skip all digits and non-printable characters.

The program should stop when the entire text has been processed or an invalid number was detected (e.g. 01238, 0xG, 1A etc).

| Input                                               | Output  |
|---                                                  |---      |
|123Abc23a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;567ab   | Abc  ab |
|asDg456&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asd356                      | Asd |
|35!79ah&nbsp;&nbsp;                                  | !ah    |
